<p>We are two students of Computer Science at a certain North German (Yay! for the weatherâ€¦ Nah, not really ðŸ˜› ) <a href="https://jacobs-university.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">university</a>. We're Full Stack Developers and like getting our hands dirty in new technologies (<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magpie</a>? maybe...). Within the realms of Computer Science, we are interested in modern information architecture technologies, database systems, web development, cloud services, robotics, human computer interaction, machine learning, and ontologies.</p>
<p>We enjoy living in multicultural and multilingual environments as it's an experience that truly changes the way you perceive life. When we're not spending time on academics or work, we usually hang out with my colleagues from over 100 different countries and love to contemplate various issues and challenges that we face in modern times.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This blog is just a collection of our often opinionated opinions (wut?) about the current state of affairs in the world of software development, and technology in general. It is in no way meant to be taken seriously. So, sit back, relax, put on some light german electronica, and enjoy.</p>
